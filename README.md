Hi everyone! 👋

This is my first attempt at building a Quick Commerce Comparison Website — a one-stop solution designed to help customers compare prices across all major quick commerce platforms (like Blinkit, Zepto, Instamart, etc.).

🔍 Key Features:

Compares product prices from different platforms
Shows the best deal to maximize user savings
Helps users make informed and cost-effective purchases
Simple, fast, and user-friendly interface
💡 The goal is to streamline shopping decisions and ensure users get the best value for their money — all in one place!
